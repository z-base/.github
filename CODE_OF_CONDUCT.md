# Code of Conduct

z-base is a technical project with architectural ambitions.
Discussion is expected to be rigorous, direct, and precise.

## Principles

- Debate ideas, not people.
- Critique architecture, not identity.
- Prefer evidence and reasoning over authority.
- Do not misrepresent others’ positions.
- Do not engage in harassment, intimidation, or personal attacks.

Strong disagreement is welcome.
Personal hostility is not.

## Technical Standards

- Claims should be backed by reasoning or references.
- Architectural discussions should distinguish between:
  - specification-level rules
  - implementation details
  - personal preferences
- Security and privacy claims must not be exaggerated.

## Unacceptable Behavior

- Harassment or discriminatory language
- Personal attacks or sustained hostility
- Intentional misinformation
- Repeated bad-faith argumentation
- Publishing private information without consent

## Enforcement

Maintainers may remove comments, close discussions, or restrict participation
if behavior violates this policy.

This project is focused on building precise, interoperable systems.
If discussion consistently prevents that, it will be moderated.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to:
- Issues
- Pull Requests
- Discussions
- Any official z-base communication channel
